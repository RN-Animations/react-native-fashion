YouTube course [React Native Fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqRnpUC4czs&t=1s&ab_channel=WilliamCandillon) on React Native Animations with William Candillon.

In this series, we are building a React Native App from 0 to 1.
The source code is available via the Start React Native Subscription at http://start-react-native.dev.

The app is based on the Outfitr - Fashion UI Kit from Flexin Studio (https://gumroad.com/l/sfEm)

Are you sometimes asking yourself, "Can it be done in React Native"? Send me your suggestions at wcandillon@gmail.com
